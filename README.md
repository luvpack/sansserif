# Sans Serif
It's a text editor that aims to redefine writing tools. Usually, they are not aesthetic, they contain a lot of unnecessary functionality. My development was created as the opposite of this, because one day I asked one question "Why?" Why should writers, copywriters, creative people who work on their subtle and not so subtle works, on art, have to work in such horrible inappropriate text editing tools?

So, I tried to recreate that atmosphere of sophistication and modern elegance, which I considered to be the one that will help creative people not to be distracted from work, not to destroy inspiration with useless, overwhelming elements, but to direct it in the right direction with its simplicity.

*Of course, my product is not perfect, it has a number of drawbacks, but I am sure that together with the community we can make this tool better and more convenient.*
